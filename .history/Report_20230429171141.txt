Check Ajeet Changes and do in the admin properly and share url with me by today. Let me know if any api needed. 

1-Search bar is missing in all data oriented tabs like you have given in User tab
1a-Transaction tab in user/seller/buyer should be within Bid, so that we relate to particular lot
1b-Most of the fields are now there but little should plan through our sheet.
1c-Amount paid & amount due in respect to buyer & seller yet not reflecting anywhere in Bid
1d-Inspection requested by buyer or new product value addition request from buyer either should auto corrected or fresh request
2-Master Tax, Correction & Additional charges are missing.
3-Master crop as discussed 
4-Transporter lead status is static it should be editable 
5-All loading data column has Vehicle number missing (And otp auto feed)-Manish knows that
6-News feed should perfectly fit into the app.
